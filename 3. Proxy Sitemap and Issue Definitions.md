# 3. Proxy Sitemap and Issue Definitions

- **Site map** allows us to map out the apps we are targeting in a tree structure. Every page that we visit will show up here, allowing us to automatically generate a site map for the target simply by browsing around the web app. 
- The Site map can be especially useful if we want to map out an API, as whenever we visit a page, any API endpoints that the page retrieves data from whilst loading will show up here.

- **Issue Definitions:** Whilst we don't have access to the Burp Suite vulnerability scanner in Burp Community, we do still have access to a list of all the vulnerabilities it looks for.
